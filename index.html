      <h4>"feminism is a collective liberation"</h4>
      <p>why does the push for women's rights bring so much controversey?</p>
      <p>what's up with the word feminism anyway?</p>
      <p>the real challenge: unite feminisits</p>
      <p>rather than playing catch up to the dominant gender, we need
        to restrucutre a new world.</p>

    <h4> a public dialogue between bell hooks & Gloria Steinem at the New School</h4>
    <p>"what is it we can give each other?"</p>
    <p>"we can not afford to paint MEN as our opposition. we need unity."</p>
    <p>"from a young age, what are we teaching boys & girls?"</p>
    <p>"what are you doing today?"</p>
    <p>small change, that's where our hope lies. we worry about what we "should" do ... do what you can.</p>

    <h4>"feminism is for everybody" by bell hooks</h4>
    <p>the little feminist handbook</p>
    <p>PATRIARCHY HAS NO GENDER</p>
    <p>what most people think they know about the movement is fed to them by the media.</p>
    <p>we need to realize, analyze, & deconstruct our own sexism before we can try to change others.</p>
    <p>everyone is a part of the system. feminism is for everybody.</p>

    <p>from places of privilege: l i s t e n </p>
    <p>how do we channel rage into love & justice rather than hatred & anger?</p>

    <h4> "Gender Troubles" by Judith Butler</h4>
    <p>"one is not born, but rather becomes a woman."</p>
    <p>"what constitutes, or ought to constitue, the category of women?"</p>
    <p>gender is culturally constructed - one becomes a woman, but only under cultural cumpulsion to be one</p>
    <p>"is there a gender people are said to have or is it an essential attribute a person is said to be?"</p>

    <h4> "The Argonauts" by Maggie Nelson</h4>
    <p>"A day or two after my love pronouncement, now feral with vulnerability, I sent you the passage from Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes in which Barthes describes how the subject who utters the phrase "I love you" is like "the Argonaut renewing his ship during its voyage without changing its name." Just as the Argo's parts may be replaced over time but the boat is still called the Argo, whenever the lover utters the phrase "I love you," its meaning must be renewed by each use, as "the very task of love and of language is to give to one and the same phrase inflections which will be forever new." </p>

    <h4>TED TALK - roxanne gay: confessions of a bad feminist </h4>
    <p>"I have passionate opinions about gender equality, but I worry that to freely accept the label of "feminist," would not be fair to good feminists."</p>
    <p>"I am a bad feminist, I am a good woman, I am trying to become better in how I think, and what I say, and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human. I hope that we can all do the same."</p>

    <h4>TED TALK - tony porter: a call to men </h4>
    <p> "I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men -- that it's okay to not be dominating, that it's okay to have feelings and emotions, that it's okay to promote equality, that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it, that it's okay to be whole, that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman."</p>
    <p>"I asked a nine-year-old boy, 'What would life be like for you, if you didn't have to adhere to this man box?' He said to me, 'I would be free.'"</p>

    <p> "That, to me, is my duty. And at this crucial time in our lives, when everything is so desperate, when every day is a matter of survival, I don't think you can help but be involved. Young people, black and white, know this. That's why they're so involved in politics. We will shape and mold this country or it will not be molded and shaped at all anymore. So, I don't think you have a choice. How can you be an artist and not reflect the times?"</p>
